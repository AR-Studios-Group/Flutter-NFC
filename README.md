# Flutter NFC

package used for NFC: [flutter_nfc_kit](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_nfc_kit)

It also contains the code for [nfc_manager](https://pub.dev/packages/nfc_manager), but it gives an error: Missing required entitlement. But my entitlement file is same as the [example given by the creater](https://github.com/okadan/nfc-manager).
